<h2 id="3-setting-up-mfa">Setting up MFA</h2>
<p>After you log in for the first time you will be told that your organization needs more information. This is
    the setup process for completing the MFA process.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The first method is an APP that needs to be installed on a smart device. We recommend installing this on
        your smart phone. <ul>
            <li>This app has no permissions to view anything on your phone, and the company is not able to see
                any data on your phone.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Follow the instructions in your web browser for how to setup the app.</li>
    <li>After installing the app and setting up the first method, it will ask you for a second method.<ul>
            <li>This form can be either a text message or an email address</li>
            <li>If you choose email, you can not use a work email</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>After you setup MFA you will be greeted with the Microsoft 365 Portal. From here you can access all the web
    apps that your license allows. Examples are Outlook, Word, Powerpoint or OneDrive. You can also access
    SharePoint sites that you have access to as well.

</ul> 
</p>
